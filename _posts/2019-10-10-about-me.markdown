I'm a fourth year PhD student in Mechanical Engineering at University of California, Santa Barbara, working with Prof. [Francesco Bullo](http://motion.me.ucsb.edu "FB's website").

Before moving to California, I was a Research Engineer in Controls at nuTonomy, a startup developing self-driving cars (now Motional).
I started as an intern in their Boston office in summer 2017, and then joined the Singapore office as full time staff until July 2019.
During my time at nuTonomy, I focused mostly on designing and implementing novel trajectory tracking controllers.

Prior to my industrial experience, in 2017 I earned a M.Sc. in Robotics, Systems and Control from ETH ZÃ¼rich, where I had the honor to work with Prof. Emilio Frazzoli, who supervised my Master's thesis on Autonomous Mobility on Demand Systems; also, in 2015 I obtained my B.Sc. in Industrial Engineering from University of Pavia, under the supervision of Prof. Davide Raimondo.

I'm originally from Pescara, a city on the Adriatic coast in Abruzzo region, Italy.
Being very proud of my homeland, all the pictures on this website show some wonderful landscapes from Abruzzo.

In my spare time I'm a mediocre water polo player.
I also love listening to Jazz and Prog music.

A CV is available upon request.
